- 안트디자인
  UI 컴포넌트들은 안트디자인 라이브러리 사용하였습니다.

  가이드 문서 참고 ↓↓↓↓

- API
  프로젝트 파일중에 src -> api폴더 -> api.js 에서 api 전체 작성할 계획입니다.
  <br/>
  (현재는 당장 필요한 api 일부만 작성해놓았는데,
  필요한 api 주소는 추가 작성하여 사용하시면 됩니다.)
  <br/>

- Table 작성법과 api 데이터를 받아서 만든 샘플화면이니
  아래 파일 참고하시면 될 것 같습니다.
  <br/>
  관리 메뉴 -> 객실 정보 관리(RoomInfoManage.js)
  <br/>
  관리 메뉴 -> 객실 유형 관리(RoomTypeManage.js)

- 조회메뉴 쪽 화면은 (일부 관리 메뉴도)
  데이터(data) 하드코딩되어 있어서 개발하실때 다시 작성해야 하는 부분 참고부탁드립니다.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
